This directory contains project/solution files for building SQLite libraries
with Microsoft Visual Studio versions 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

To build SQLite, you will need to download two SQLite packages: sqlite-
amalgamation and sqlite-dll. Copy the sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h files from the
first package and the sqlite3.def file from the second package into the
directory with the project/solution files. Then open the solution and build
the desired configurations (Debug/Release) and platforms (Win32/x64).

The resulting 32-bit DLLs and import libraries are placed into the bin\ and
lib\ sub-directories, respectively. Similarly, the 64-bit DLLs and import
libraries are placed into bin64\ and lib64\. The Release versions of the
import libraries are named sqlite3.lib and the Debug versions are named
sqlite3-d.lib.

To configure Visual Studio to automatically locate the SQLite header, DLLs,
and import libraries, add the following paths to your VC++ Directories (below
sqlite refers to the build directory):

Win32:

  Include:    ...\sqlite
  Library:    ...\sqlite\lib
  Executable: ...\sqlite\bin

x64:

  Include:    ...\sqlite
  Library:    ...\sqlite\lib64
  Executable: ...\sqlite\bin64
