ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides
tools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects
to a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables,
columns, or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.

This package contains the pre-compiled binary distribution of the ODB
compiler for Windows. The top-level directory structure of this package
is as follows:

bin\          ODB compiler binary
etc\          ODB compiler configuration
doc\          ODB system documentation
man\          man pages for the ODB compiler
mingw\        GCC compiler, MinGW, and MSYS binaries, see manifest
              inside for details

To install this package simply unpack it into a directory of your choice,
for example C:\tools. The ODB compiler binary will be in the bin\
directory inside the package directory, for example
C:\tools\odb-x.y.z-i686-windows\bin\. You can run the ODB compiler by
either using the absolute path, for example:

C:\tools\odb-x.y.z-i686-windows\bin\odb --version

Or you can add the bin\ directory to the Path environment variable. To
accomplish this, open Control Panel, then System, select the Advanced tab
and click on the Environment Variables button. If you have administrator
privileges, select the Path variable from the System variables list.
Otherwise, select (or create) the Path variable from the User variables
list. Click the Edit button and add the bin\ directory to the list. Click
Ok, then log off and log on again for the changes to take effect. Once this
is done, you should be able to run the ODB compiler by using just its name,
for example:

odb --version

If you would like to add commonly-used libraries, such as Boost or Qt,
to the ODB compiler header search list, you can add them to the
etc\odb\default.options file (this file serves a similar purpose in ODB
as the VC++ Directories dialog in VC++). For more information, refer to
the instructions at the beginning of this file.

Note also that while you can move the ODB compiler directory around, you
cannot move the individual sub-directories or files inside it. For example,
copying the ODB compiler executable to C:\Windows will not work.
