.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"--------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a set of C++ classes in a header file,
.B odb
generates C++ code that allows you to persist, query, and update objects
of these classes in a relational database (RDBMS). The relational
database that the generated code should target is specified with the
required
.B --database
option (see below).


For an input file in the form
.B name.hxx
(other file extensions can be used instead of
.BR .hxx ),
in the single-database mode (the default), the generated C++ files by
default have the following names:
.B name-odb.hxx
(header file),
.B name-odb.ixx
(inline file), and
.B name-odb.cxx
(source file). Additionally, if the
.B --generate-schema
option is specified and the
.B sql
schema format is requested (see
.BR --schema-format ),
the
.B name.sql
database schema file is generated. If the
.B separate
schema format is requested, the database creation code is generated into
the separate
.B name-schema.cxx
file.


In the multi-database mode (see the
.B --multi-database
option below), the generated files corresponding to the
.B common
database have the same names as in the single-database mode. For other
databases, the file names include the database name:
.BR name-odb-\fIdb\fB.hxx ,
.BR name-odb-\fIdb\fB.ixx ,
.BR name-odb-\fIdb\fB.cxx ,
.BR name-\fIdb\fB.sql ,
and
.B name-schema-\fIdb\fB.cxx
(where
.I db
is the database name).

.\"
.\" The following documentation was generated by CLI, a command
.\" line interface compiler for C++.
.\"
.IP "\fB--help\fP"
Print usage information and exit\.

.IP "\fB--version\fP"
Print version and exit\.

.IP "\fB-I\fP \fIdir\fP"
Add \fIdir\fP to the beginning of the list of directories to be searched for
included header files\.

.IP "\fB-D\fP \fIname\fP[=\fIdef\fP]"
Define macro \fIname\fP with definition \fIdef\fP\. If definition is
omitted, define \fIname\fP to be 1\.

.IP "\fB-U\fP \fIname\fP"
Cancel any previous definitions of macro \fIname\fP, either built-in or
provided with the \fB-D\fP option\.

.IP "\fB--database\fP|\fB-d\fP \fIdb\fP"
Generate code for the \fIdb\fP database\. Valid values are \fBmssql\fP,
\fBmysql\fP, \fBoracle\fP, \fBpgsql\fP, \fBsqlite\fP, and \fBcommon\fP
(multi-database mode only)\.

.IP "\fB--multi-database\fP|\fB-m\fP \fItype\fP"
Enable multi-database support and specify its type\. Valid values for this
option are \fBstatic\fP and \fBdynamic\fP\.

In the multi-database mode, options that determine the kind (for example,
\fB--schema-format\fP), names (for example, \fB--odb-file-suffix\fP), or
content (for example, prologue and epilogue options) of the output files can
be prefixed with the database name followed by a colon, for example,
\fBmysql:value\fP\. This restricts the value of such an option to only apply
to generated files corresponding to this database\.

.IP "\fB--default-database\fP \fIdb\fP"
When static multi-database support is used, specify the database that should
be made the default\. When dynamic multi-database support is used,
\fBcommon\fP is always made the default database\.

.IP "\fB--generate-query\fP|\fB-q\fP"
Generate query support code\. Without this support you cannot use views and
can only load objects via their ids\.

.IP "\fB--generate-prepared\fP"
Generate prepared query execution support code\.

.IP "\fB--omit-unprepared\fP"
Omit un-prepared (once-off) query execution support code\.

.IP "\fB--generate-session\fP|\fB-e\fP"
Generate session support code\. With this option session support will be
enabled by default for all the persistent classes except those for which it
was explicitly disabled using the \fBdb session\fP pragma\.

.IP "\fB--generate-schema\fP|\fB-s\fP"
Generate the database schema\. The database schema contains SQL statements
that create database tables necessary to store persistent classes defined in
the file being compiled\. Note that by applying this schema, all the
existing information stored in such tables will be lost\.

Depending on the database being used (\fB--database\fP option), the schema
is generated either as a standalone SQL file or embedded into the generated
C++ code\. By default the SQL file is generated for the MySQL, PostgreSQL,
Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server databases and the schema is embedded into
the C++ code for the SQLite database\. Use the \fB--schema-format\fP option
to alter the default schema format\.

If database schema evolution support is enabled (that is, the object model
version is specified), then this option also triggers the generation of
database schema migration statements, again either as standalong SQL files
or embedded into the generated C++ code\. You can suppress the generation of
schema migration statements by specifying the \fB--suppress-migration\fP
option\.

.IP "\fB--generate-schema-only\fP"
Generate only the database schema\. Note that this option is only valid when
generating schema as a standalone SQL file (see \fB--schema-format\fP for
details)\.

.IP "\fB--suppress-migration\fP"
Suppress the generation of database schema migration statements\.

.IP "\fB--suppress-schema-version\fP"
Suppress the generation of schema version table\. If you specify this option
then you are also expected to manually specify the database schema version
and migration state at runtime using the
\fBodb::database::schema_version()\fP function\.

.IP "\fB--schema-version-table\fP \fIname\fP"
Specify the alternative schema version table name instead of the default
\fBschema_version\fP\. If you specify this option then you are also expected
to manually specify the schema version table name at runtime using the
\fBodb::database::schema_version_table()\fP function\. The table name can be
qualified\.

.IP "\fB--schema-format\fP \fIformat\fP"
Generate the database schema in the specified format\. Pass \fBsql\fP as
\fIformat\fP to generate the database schema as a standalone SQL file or
pass \fBembedded\fP to embed the schema into the generated C++ code\. The
\fBseparate\fP value is similar to \fBembedded\fP except the schema creation
code is generated into a separate C++ file (\fBname-schema\.cxx\fP by
default)\. This value is primarily useful if you want to place the schema
creation functionality into a separate program or library\. Repeat this
option to generate the same database schema in multiple formats\.

.IP "\fB--omit-drop\fP"
Omit \fBDROP\fP statements from the generated database schema\.

.IP "\fB--omit-create\fP"
Omit \fBCREATE\fP statements from the generated database schema\.

.IP "\fB--schema-name\fP \fIname\fP"
Use \fIname\fP as the database schema name\. Schema names are primarily used
to distinguish between multiple embedded schemas in the schema catalog\.
They are not to be confused with database schemas (database namespaces)
which are specified with the \fB--schema\fP option\. If this option is not
specified, the empty name, which is the default schema name, is used\.

.IP "\fB--fkeys-deferrable-mode\fP \fIm\fP"
Use constraint checking mode \fIm\fP in foreign keys generated for object
relationships\. Valid values for this option are \fBnot_deferrable\fP,
\fBimmediate\fP, and \fBdeferred\fP (default)\. MySQL and SQL Server do not
support deferrable foreign keys and for these databases such keys are
generated commented out\. Other foreign keys generated by the ODB compiler
(such as the ones used to support containers and polymorphic hierarchies)
are always generated as not deferrable\.

Note also that if you use either \fBnot_deferrable\fP or \fBimmediate\fP
mode, then the order in which you persist, update, and erase objects within
a transaction becomes important\.

.IP "\fB--default-pointer\fP \fIptr\fP"
Use \fIptr\fP as the default pointer for persistent objects and views\.
Objects and views that do not have a pointer assigned with the \fBdb
pointer\fP pragma will use this pointer by default\. The value of this
option can be \fB*\fP which denotes the raw pointer and is the default, or
qualified name of a smart pointer class template, for example,
\fBstd::auto_ptr\fP\. In the latter case, the ODB compiler constructs the
object or view pointer by adding a single template argument of the object or
view type to the qualified name, for example \fBstd::auto_ptr<object>\fP\.
The ODB runtime uses object and view pointers to return, and, in case of
objects, pass and cache dynamically allocated instances of object and view
types\.

Except for the raw pointer and the standard smart pointers defined in the
\fB<memory>\fP header file, you are expected to include the definition of
the default pointer at the beginning of the generated header file\. There
are two common ways to achieve this: you can either include the necessary
header in the file being compiled or you can use the \fB--hxx-prologue\fP
option to add the necessary \fB#include\fP directive to the generated code\.

.IP "\fB--session-type\fP \fItype\fP"
Use \fItype\fP as the alternative session type instead of the default
\fBodb::session\fP\. This option can be used to specify a custom session
implementation to be use by the persistent classes\. Note that you will also
need to include the definition of the custom session type into the generated
header file\. This is normally achieved with the \fB--hxx-prologue*\fP
options\.

.IP "\fB--profile\fP|\fB-p\fP \fIname\fP"
Specify a profile that should be used during compilation\. A profile is an
options file\. The ODB compiler first looks for a database-specific version
with the name constructed by appending the
\fB-\fP\fIdatabase\fP\fB\.options\fP suffix to \fIname\fP, where
\fIdatabase\fP is the database name as specified with the \fB--database\fP
option\. If this file is not found, then the ODB compiler looks for a
database-independant version with the name constructed by appending just the
\fB\.options\fP suffix\.

The profile options files are searched for in the same set of directories as
C++ headers included with the \fB#include <\.\.\.>\fP directive (built-in
paths plus those specified with the \fB-I\fP options)\. The options file is
first searched for in the directory itself and then in its \fBodb/\fP
subdirectory\.

For the format of the options file refer to the \fB--options-file\fP option
below\. You can repeat this option to specify more than one profile\.

.IP "\fB--at-once\fP"
Generate code for all the input files as well as for all the files that they
include at once\. The result is a single set of source/schema files that
contain all the generated code\. If more than one input file is specified
together with this option, then the \fB--input-name\fP option must also be
specified in order to provide the base name for the output files\. In this
case, the directory part of such a base name is used as the location of the
combined file\. This can be important for the \fB#include\fP directive
resolution\.

.IP "\fB--schema\fP \fIschema\fP"
Specify a database schema (database namespace) that should be assigned to
the persistent classes in the file being compiled\. Database schemas are not
to be confused with database schema names (schema catalog names) which are
specified with the \fB--schema-name\fP option\.

.IP "\fB--export-symbol\fP \fIsymbol\fP"
Insert \fIsymbol\fP in places where DLL export/import control statements
(\fB__declspec(dllexport/dllimport)\fP) are necessary\. See also the
\fB--extern-symbol\fP option below\.

.IP "\fB--extern-symbol\fP \fIsymbol\fP"
If \fIsymbol\fP is defined, insert it in places where a template
instantiation must be declared \fBextern\fP\. This option is normally used
together with \fB--export-symbol\fP when both multi-database support and
queries are enabled\.

.IP "\fB--std\fP \fIversion\fP"
Specify the C++ standard that should be used during compilation\. Valid
values are \fBc++98\fP (default), \fBc++11\fP, and \fBc++14\fP\.

.IP "\fB--warn-hard-add\fP"
Warn about hard-added data members\.

.IP "\fB--warn-hard-delete\fP"
Warn about hard-deleted data members and persistent classes\.

.IP "\fB--warn-hard\fP"
Warn about both hard-added and hard-deleted data members and persistent
classes\.

.IP "\fB--output-dir\fP|\fB-o\fP \fIdir\fP"
Write the generated files to \fIdir\fP instead of the current directory\.

.IP "\fB--input-name\fP \fIname\fP"
Use \fIname\fP instead of the input file to derive the names of the
generated files\. If the \fB--at-once\fP option is specified, then the
directory part of \fIname\fP is used as the location of the combined file\.
Refer to the \fB--at-once\fP option for details\.

.IP "\fB--changelog\fP \fIfile\fP"
Read/write changelog from/to \fIfile\fP instead of the default changelog
file\. The default changelog file name is derived from the input file name
and it is placed into the same directory as the input file\. Note that the
\fB--output-dir\fP option does not affect the changelog file location\. In
other words, by default, the changelog file is treated as another input
rather than output even though the ODB compiler may modify it\. Use the
\fB--changelog-in\fP and \fB--changelog-out\fP options to specify different
input and output chaneglog files\.

.IP "\fB--changelog-in\fP \fIfile\fP"
Read changelog from \fIfile\fP instead of the default changelog file\. If
this option is specified, then you must also specify the output chanegelog
file with \fB--changelog-out\fP\.

.IP "\fB--changelog-out\fP \fIfile\fP"
Write changelog to \fIfile\fP instead of the default changelog file\. If
this option is specified, then you must also specify the input chanegelog
file with \fB--changelog-in\fP\.

.IP "\fB--changelog-dir\fP \fIdir\fP"
Use \fIdir\fP instead of the input file directory as the changelog file
directory\. This directory is also added to changelog files specified with
the \fB--changelog\fP, \fB--changelog-in\fP, and \fB--changelog-in\fP
options unless they are absolute paths\.

.IP "\fB--init-changelog\fP"
Force re-initialization of the changelog even if one exists (all the
existing change history will be lost)\. This option is primarily useful for
automated testing\.

.IP "\fB--odb-file-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP"
Use \fIsuffix\fP to construct the names of the generated C++ files\. In the
single-database mode the default value for this option is \fB-odb\fP\. In
the multi-database mode it is \fB-odb\fP for the files corresponding to the
\fBcommon\fP database and \fB-odb-\fP\fIdb\fP (where \fIdb\fP is the
database name) for other databases\.

.IP "\fB--sql-file-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP"
Use \fIsuffix\fP to construct the name of the generated schema SQL file\. In
the single-database mode by default no suffix is used\. In the
multi-database mode the default value for this option is \fB-\fP\fIdb\fP
(where \fIdb\fP is the database name)\.

.IP "\fB--schema-file-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP"
Use \fIsuffix\fP to construct the name of the generated schema C++ source
file\. In the single-database mode the default value for this option is
\fB-schema\fP\. In the multi-database mode it is \fB-schema-\fP\fIdb\fP
(where \fIdb\fP is the database name)\. See the \fB--schema-format\fP option
for details\.

.IP "\fB--changelog-file-suffix\fP \fIsfx\fP"
Use \fIsfx\fP to construct the name of the changelog file\. In the
single-database mode by default no suffix is used\. In the multi-database
mode the default value for this option is \fB-\fP\fIdb\fP (where \fIdb\fP is
the database name)\.

.IP "\fB--hxx-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP"
Use \fIsuffix\fP instead of the default \fB\.hxx\fP to construct the name of
the generated C++ header file\.

.IP "\fB--ixx-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP"
Use \fIsuffix\fP instead of the default \fB\.ixx\fP to construct the name of
the generated C++ inline file\.

.IP "\fB--cxx-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP"
Use \fIsuffix\fP instead of the default \fB\.cxx\fP to construct the name of
the generated C++ source file\.

.IP "\fB--sql-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP"
Use \fIsuffix\fP instead of the default \fB\.sql\fP to construct the name of
the generated database schema file\.

.IP "\fB--changelog-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP"

compiled after all the epilogue text fragments (\fB--odb-epilogue\fP
option)\.

.IP "\fB--table-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP"
Add \fIprefix\fP to table names and, for databases that have global index
and/or foreign key names, to those names as well\. The prefix is added to
both names that were specified with the \fBdb table\fP and \fBdb index\fP
pragmas and those that were automatically derived from class and data member
names\. If you require a separator, such as an underscore, between the
prefix and the name, then you should include it into the prefix value\.

.IP "\fB--index-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP"
Use \fIsuffix\fP instead of the default \fB_i\fP to construct index names\.
The suffix is only added to names that were automatically derived from data
member names\. If you require a separator, such as an underscore, between
the name and the suffix, then you should include it into the suffix value\.

.IP "\fB--fkey-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP"
Use \fIsuffix\fP instead of the default \fB_fk\fP to construct foreign key
names\. If you require a separator, such as an underscore, between the name
and the suffix, then you should include it into the suffix value\.

.IP "\fB--sequence-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP"
Use \fIsuffix\fP instead of the default \fB_seq\fP to construct sequence
names\. If you require a separator, such as an underscore, between the name
and the suffix, then you should include it into the suffix value\.

.IP "\fB--sql-name-case\fP \fIcase\fP"
Convert all automatically-derived SQL names to upper or lower case\. Valid
values for this option are  \fBupper\fP and \fBlower\fP\.

.IP "\fB--table-regex\fP \fIregex\fP"
Add \fIregex\fP to the list of regular expressions that is used to transform
automatically-derived table names\. See the SQL NAME TRANSFORMATIONS section
below for details\.

.IP "\fB--column-regex\fP \fIregex\fP"
Add \fIregex\fP to the list of regular expressions that is used to transform
automatically-derived column names\. See the SQL NAME TRANSFORMATIONS
section below for details\.

.IP "\fB--index-regex\fP \fIregex\fP"
Add \fIregex\fP to the list of regular expressions that is used to transform
automatically-derived index names\. See the SQL NAME TRANSFORMATIONS section
below for details\.

.IP "\fB--fkey-regex\fP \fIregex\fP"
Add \fIregex\fP to the list of regular expressions that is used to transform
automatically-derived foreign key names\. See the SQL NAME TRANSFORMATIONS
section below for details\.

.IP "\fB--sequence-regex\fP \fIregex\fP"
Add \fIregex\fP to the list of regular expressions that is used to transform
automatically-derived sequence names\. See the SQL NAME TRANSFORMATIONS
section below for details\.

.IP "\fB--statement-regex\fP \fIregex\fP"
Add \fIregex\fP to the list of regular expressions that is used to transform
automatically-derived prepared statement names\. See the SQL NAME
TRANSFORMATIONS section below for details\.

.IP "\fB--sql-name-regex\fP \fIregex\fP"
Add \fIregex\fP to the list of regular expressions that is used to transform
all automatically-derived SQL names\. See the SQL NAME TRANSFORMATIONS
section below for details\.

.IP "\fB--sql-name-regex-trace\fP"
Trace the process of applying regular expressions specified with the SQL
name \fB--*-regex\fP options\. Use this option to find out why your regular
expressions don't do what you expected them to do\.

.IP "\fB--accessor-regex\fP \fIregex\fP"
Add \fIregex\fP to the list of regular expressions used to transform data
member names to function names when searching for a suitable accessor
function\. The argument to this option is a Perl-like regular expression in
the form \fB/\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB/\fP\fIreplacement\fP\fB/\fP\. Any character
can be used as a delimiter instead of \fB/\fP and the delimiter can be
escaped inside \fIpattern\fP and \fIreplacement\fP with a backslash
(\fB\e\fP)\. You can specify multiple regular expressions by repeating this
option\.

All the regular expressions are tried in the order specified and the first
expression that produces a suitable accessor function is used\. Each
expression is tried twice: first with the actual member name and then with
the member's \fIpublic name\fP which is obtained by removing the common
member name decorations, such as leading and trailing underscores, the
\fBm_\fP prefix, etc\. The ODB compiler also includes a number of built-in
expressions for commonly used accessor names, such as \fBget_foo\fP,
\fBgetFoo\fP, \fBgetfoo\fP, and just \fBfoo\fP\. The built-in expressions
are tried last\.

As an example, the following expression transforms data members with public
names in the form \fBfoo\fP to accessor names in the form \fBGetFoo\fP:

\fB/(\.+)/Get\eu$1/\fP

See also the REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.

.IP "\fB--accessor-regex-trace\fP"
Trace the process of applying regular expressions specified with the
\fB--accessor-regex\fP option\. Use this option to find out why your regular
expressions don't do what you expected them to do\.

.IP "\fB--modifier-regex\fP \fIregex\fP"
Add \fIregex\fP to the list of regular expressions used to transform data
member names to function names when searching for a suitable modifier
function\. The argument to this option is a Perl-like regular expression in
the form \fB/\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB/\fP\fIreplacement\fP\fB/\fP\. Any character
can be used as a delimiter instead of \fB/\fP and the delimiter can be
escaped inside \fIpattern\fP and \fIreplacement\fP with a backslash
(\fB\e\fP)\. You can specify multiple regular expressions by repeating this
option\.

All the regular expressions are tried in the order specified and the first
expression that produces a suitable modifier function is used\. Each
expression is tried twice: first with the actual member name and then with
the member's \fIpublic name\fP which is obtained by removing the common
member name decorations, such as leading and trailing underscores, the
\fBm_\fP prefix, etc\. The ODB compiler also includes a number of built-in
expressions for commonly used modifier names, such as \fBset_foo\fP,
\fBsetFoo\fP, \fBsetfoo\fP, and just \fBfoo\fP\. The built-in expressions
are tried last\.

As an example, the following expression transforms data members with public
names in the form \fBfoo\fP to modifier names in the form \fBSetFoo\fP:

\fB/(\.+)/Set\eu$1/\fP

See also the REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.

.IP "\fB--modifier-regex-trace\fP"
Trace the process of applying regular expressions specified with the
\fB--modifier-regex\fP option\. Use this option to find out why your regular
expressions don't do what you expected them to do\.

.IP "\fB--include-with-brackets\fP"
Use angle brackets (<>) instead of quotes ("") in the generated
\fB#include\fP directives\.

.IP "\fB--include-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP"
Add \fIprefix\fP to the generated \fB#include\fP directive paths\.

.IP "\fB--include-regex\fP \fIregex\fP"
Add \fIregex\fP to the list of regular expressions used to transform
generated \fB#include\fP directive paths\. The argument to this option is a
Perl-like regular expression in the form
\fB/\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB/\fP\fIreplacement\fP\fB/\fP\. Any character can be
used as a delimiter instead of \fB/\fP and the delimiter can be escaped
inside \fIpattern\fP and \fIreplacement\fP with a backslash (\fB\e\fP)\. You
can specify multiple regular expressions by repeating this option\. All the
regular expressions are tried in the order specified and the first
expression that matches is used\.

As an example, the following expression transforms include paths in the form
\fBfoo/bar-odb\.h\fP to paths in the form \fBfoo/generated/bar-odb\.h\fP:

\fB%foo/(\.+)-odb\.h%foo/generated/$1-odb\.h%\fP

See also the REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.

.IP "\fB--include-regex-trace\fP"
Trace the process of applying regular expressions specified with the
\fB--include-regex\fP option\. Use this option to find out why your regular
expressions don't do what you expected them to do\.

.IP "\fB--guard-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP"
Add \fIprefix\fP to the generated header inclusion guards\. The prefix is
transformed to upper case and characters that are illegal in a preprocessor
macro name are replaced with underscores\.

.IP "\fB--show-sloc\fP"
Print the number of generated physical source lines of code (SLOC)\.

.IP "\fB--sloc-limit\fP \fInum\fP"
Check that the number of generated physical source lines of code (SLOC) does
not exceed \fInum\fP\.

.IP "\fB--options-file\fP \fIfile\fP"
Read additional options from \fIfile\fP with each option appearing on a
separate line optionally followed by space and an option value\. Empty lines
and lines starting with \fB#\fP are ignored\. Option values can be enclosed
in double (\fB"\fP) or single (\fB'\fP) quotes  to preserve leading and
trailing whitespaces as well as to specify empty values\. If the value
itself contains trailing or leading quotes, enclose it with an extra pair of
quotes, for example \fB'"x"'\fP\. Non-leading and non-trailing quotes are
interpreted as being part of the option value\.

The semantics of providing options in a file is equivalent to providing the
same set of options in the same order on the command line at the point where
the \fB--options-file\fP option is specified except that the shell escaping
and quoting is not required\. You can repeat this option to specify more
than one options file\.

.IP "\fB-x\fP \fIoption\fP"
Pass \fIoption\fP to the underlying C++ compiler (\fBg++\fP)\. The
\fIoption\fP value that doesn't start with \fB-\fP is considered the
\fBg++\fP executable name\.

.IP "\fB-v\fP"
Print the commands executed to run the stages of compilation\.

.IP "\fB--trace\fP"
Trace the compilation process\.

.IP "\fB--mysql-engine\fP \fIengine\fP"
Use \fIengine\fP instead of the default \fBInnoDB\fP in the generated
database schema file\. For more information on the storage engine options
see the MySQL documentation\. If you would like to use the database-default
engine, pass \fBdefault\fP as the value for this option\.

.IP "\fB--sqlite-override-null\fP"
Make all columns in the generated database schema allow \fBNULL\fP values\.
This is primarily useful in schema migration since SQLite does not support
dropping of columns\. By making all columns \fBNULL\fP we can later "delete"
them by setting their values to \fBNULL\fP\. Note that this option overrides
even the \fBnot_null\fP pragma\.

.IP "\fB--sqlite-lax-auto-id\fP"
Do not force monotonically increasing automatically-assigned object ids\. In
this mode the generated database schema omits the \fBAUTOINCREMENT\fP
keyword which results in faster object persistence but may lead to
automatically-assigned ids not being in a strictly ascending order\. Refer
to the SQLite documentation for details\.

.IP "\fB--pgsql-server-version\fP \fIver\fP"
Specify the minimum PostgreSQL server version with which the generated C++
code and schema will be used\. This information is used to enable
version-specific optimizations and workarounds in the generated C++ code and
schema\. The version must be in the \fImajor\fP\fB\.\fP\fIminor\fP form, for
example, \fB9\.1\fP\. If this option is not specified, then \fB7\.4\fP or
later is assumed\.

.IP "\fB--oracle-client-version\fP \fIver\fP"
Specify the minimum Oracle client library (OCI) version with which the
generated C++ code will be linked\. This information is used to enable
version-specific optimizations and workarounds in the generated C++ code\.
The version must be in the \fImajor\fP\fB\.\fP\fIminor\fP form, for example,
\fB11\.2\fP\. If this option is not specified, then \fB10\.1\fP or later is
assumed\.

.IP "\fB--oracle-warn-truncation\fP"
Warn about SQL names that are longer than 30 characters and are therefore
truncated\. Note that during database schema generation
(\fB--generate-schema\fP) ODB detects when such truncations lead to name
conflicts and issues diagnostics even without this option specified\.

.IP "\fB--mssql-server-version\fP \fIver\fP"
Specify the minimum SQL Server server version with which the generated C++
code and schema will be used\. This information is used to enable
version-specific optimizations and workarounds in the generated C++ code and
schema\. The version must be in the \fImajor\fP\fB\.\fP\fIminor\fP form, for
example, \fB9\.0\fP (SQL Server 2005), \fB10\.5\fP (2008R2), or \fB11\.0\fP
(2012)\. If this option is not specified, then \fB10\.0\fP (SQL Server 2008)
or later is assumed\.

.IP "\fB--mssql-short-limit\fP \fIsize\fP"
Specify the short data size limit\. If a character, national character, or
binary data type has a maximum length (in bytes) less than or equal to this
limit, then it is treated as \fIshort data\fP, otherwise it is \fIlong
data\fP\. For short data ODB pre-allocates an intermediate buffer of the
maximum size and binds it directly to a parameter or result column\. This
way the underlying API (ODBC) can read/write directly from/to this buffer\.
In the case of long data, the data is read/written in chunks using the
\fBSQLGetData()\fP/\fBSQLPutData()\fP ODBC functions\. While the long data
approach reduces the amount of memory used by the application, it may
require greater CPU resources\. The default short data limit is 1024 bytes\.
When setting a custom short data limit, make sure that it is sufficiently
large so that no object id in the application is treated as long data\.

.\" SQL NAME TRANSFORMATIONS
.\"
.SH SQL NAME TRANSFORMATIONS
The ODB compiler provides a number of mechanisms for transforming
automatically-derived SQL names, such as tables, columns, etc.,
to match a specific naming convention. At the higher level, we can
add a prefix to global names (tables and, for some databases,
indexes and/or foreign keys) with the
.B --table-prefix
option. Similarly, we can specify custom suffixes for automatically-derived
index
.RB ( --index-suffix ;
default is
.BR _i ),
foreign key
.RB ( --fkey-suffix ;
default is
.BR _fk ),
and sequence
.RB ( --sequence-suffix ;
default is
.BR _seq )
names. Finally, we can also convert all the names to upper or lower
case with the
.B --sql-name-case
option (valid values are
.B upper
and
.BR lower ).

At the lower level we can specify a set of regular expressions to
implement arbitrary transformations of the automatically-derived SQL
names. If we want a particular regular expression only to apply to
a specific name, for example, table or column, then we use one of the
.B --\fIkind\fB-regex
options, where
.I kind
can be
.BR table ,
.BR column ,
.BR index ,
.BR fkey ,
.BR sequence ,
or
.BR statement .
On the other hand, if we want our regular expressions to apply to all SQL
names, then we use the
.B --sql-name-regex
option.

The interaction between the higher and lower level transformations
is as follows. Prefixes and suffixes are added first. Then the
regular expression transformations are applied. Finally, if requested,
the name is converted to upper or lower case. Note also that all of
these transformations except for
.B --table-prefix
only apply to automatically-derived names. In other words, if a table,
column, etc., name was explicitly specified with a pragma, then it
is used as is, without applying any (except for the table prefix)
transformations.

The value for the
.B --*-regex
options is a Perl-like regular expression in the form
.BI / pattern / replacement /\fR.
Any character can be used as a delimiter instead of
.B /
and the delimiter can be escaped inside
.I pattern
and
.I replacement
with a backslash
.RB ( \e ).
You can also specify multiple regular expressions by repeating these
options.

All the regular expressions are tried in the order specified with the
name-specific expressions (for example,
.BR --table-regex)
tried first followed by the generic expressions
.RB ( --sql-name-regex ).
The first expression that matches is used.

As an example, consider a regular expression that transforms a class
name in the form
.B CFoo
to a table name in the form
.BR FOO:

.B --table-regex '/C(.+)/\eU$1/'

As a more interesting example, consider the transformation of class
names that follow the upper camel case convention (for example,
.BR FooBar )
to table names that follow the underscore-separated, all upper case
convention (for example,
.BR FOO_BAR ).
For this case we have to use separate expressions to handle one-word,
two-word, etc., names:

.B --table-regex '/([A-z][a-z]+)/\eU$1/'

.B --table-regex '/([A-z][a-z]+)([A-z][a-z]+)/\eU$1_$2/'

.\"
.\" REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING
.\"
.SH REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING
When entering a regular expression argument in the shell command line
it is often necessary to use quoting (enclosing the argument in " "
or ' ') in order to prevent the shell from interpreting certain
characters, for example, spaces as argument separators and $ as
variable expansions.

Unfortunately it is hard to achieve this in a manner that is portable
across POSIX shells, such as those found on GNU/Linux and UNIX, and
Windows shell. For example, if you use " " for quoting you will get
a wrong result with POSIX shells if your expression contains $. The
standard way of dealing with this on POSIX systems is to use ' '
instead. Unfortunately, Windows shell does not remove ' '  from
arguments when they are passed to applications. As a result you may
have to use ' ' for POSIX and " " for Windows ($ is not treated as
a special character on Windows).

Alternatively, you can save regular expression options into a file,
one option per line, and use this file with the
.B --options-file
option. With this approach you don't need to worry about shell quoting.
