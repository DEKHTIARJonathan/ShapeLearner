# Default ODB options file. This file is automatically loaded by the ODB
# compiler and can be used for installation-wide customizations, such as
# adding an include search path for a commonly used library. In this
# regard, the default options file in ODB serves a role similar to the
# VC++ Directories dialog in VC++. For example:
#
# -I C:\boost_1_45_0
