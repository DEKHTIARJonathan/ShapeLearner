Legend: (-) to be done; 
	(+) partailly done;  
	(*) done completely

(-)	Implement computeDistance(point, t1, t2) for CircSeg as well

(-)	Implement multiscale discrete divergence skeleton. That is,
	start at a low resolution and thin with a high divergence
	threshold; then add more points around this first
	approximation of the skeleton at higher resolution and thin
	again. 

(-)     The isInside() function in SimpleShape must be implemented.
	Right now, it always returns false.

(-)     For actual DT and divergence calculations (inside/outside
        actually) it is important to have smooth curves as
        contours. Maybe a new Curve type is required specifically for
        binary images.

(-)     DiscreteSegCurve has some inefficiencies -- closest point related

(-)     Make sure the destructors kill everything.


!) Update DiscreteShape; that is, remove the drawing parts and such...
   enough to use the sign...

For Curve's:
	imlpement subCurve()
	test cloning
 	    this includes DiscreteSegCurve CurveSeg and LineSeg


In RecLattice:
	implement completely the getIndex function. 
	here index[0] is the closest point and index[3] is the furthest

Solved     There is a weird behavior of testDistanceTransform when compiled
by not     with optimization -- both -O and -O2 cause it to seg. fault in
using      flood_fill() inside the construction of a DiscreteShape. It may be
DiscShape  caused by a small heap in the compilation...
