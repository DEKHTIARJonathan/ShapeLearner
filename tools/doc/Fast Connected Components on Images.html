</p><h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>

In image processing, a connected components algorithm finds regions of
connected pixels which have the same value. For example, the image
below contains 4 components: there are 2 red components, one blue
component, and the white, background component. The label image to the
right colors each pixel according to the ID of its blob, identifying
blob membership. The goal of connected components is to compute this
label image.

</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
The are good and bad ways of finding connected components. A bad way
is to start a flood-fill (like the paint bucket in a painting program)
at every pixel. This runs an expensive process for every pixel. In
fact, calling a recursive function for each pixel is bad because
recursion doesn't take advantage of the compiler's loop optimizations.
In addition, recursive methods typically touch the image in an
incoherent way, producing lots of cache faults.
</p><p>
A good method would be to process the image one image line at a time,
or two lines at a time, maintaining cache locality. A bad
line-at-a-time method is one that continuously makes forward and
backward passes on the image. A better one is one that does one
forward pass then one backward pass.
</p><p>
The correct algorithm is one that does one forward pass and then
labels the target image according to information gathered during its
pass. This method uses the union-find data structure to build an
internal representation of the connectedness of the image during the
pass. Its running time is approximately O(N), where N is the number of
pixels.

</p><p>
</p><h2>2.0 The Algorithm</h2>
<p>
For each pixel on the line, this implementation first checks to see if
the pixel to the left has the same pixel value. If so, we know for
sure that we're in the same blob, and the current pixel is so
labeled. If the pixel at the top has the same value as the pixel to
the left but not the same blob ID, we know at once that the pixels to
the left and to the top are in the same region and that these regions
should be merged.
</p><p>
If a pixel is found with left and top neighbor having different pixel
values, a new blob id is created and assigned to this pixel.
</p><p>
The algorithm continues this way, creating new blobs and merging them
whenever they are discovered to be the same. The key to a fast
algorithm, however, is how this merging is done. This algorithm uses
the union-find data structure which provides excellent performance for
keeping track of equivalence relationships (see <em>Introduction to
Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest</em> for a description).
Union-find essentially stores labels which correspond to the same blob
in a tree, making it easy to remember the equivalence of two labels.



</p><p>
</p><h2>3.0 Examples</h2>
<p>
The following images show the result of running the algorithm on a
screendump. The left image is the original image. The right one is the
label image.
</p><p>
<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><td><img src="Fast%20Connected%20Components%20on%20Images_files/screendump.gif"></td>
<td><img src="Fast%20Connected%20Components%20on%20Images_files/screen-blobs.gif"></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
Notice that letter that are not touching are correctly segmented with
differenti IDs.
</p><p>
Here's another example run on a hand-drawn image:
</p><p>
<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><td><img src="Fast%20Connected%20Components%20on%20Images_files/snoopy.gif"></td>
<td><img src="Fast%20Connected%20Components%20on%20Images_files/snoopy-labels.gif"></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
</p><h2>4.0 Using</h2>
<p>
There are only two functions that you need to worry about when using
this algorithm. It is implemented in C++ and the class
<code>ConnectedComponents</code> exports all the functionality.
</p><p>
First, create a <code>ConnectedComponents</code> by calling the
constructor.  Specify a soft maximum number of labels you expect in
the image. This number is used to allocate some arrays which are resized
while the algorithm runs, so don't worry about an exact value.

</p><p>
Then call <code>ConnectedComponents::connected()</code>. The signature
of this function is:
</p><p>
<table border="1" width="90%"><tbody><tr><td>
<code></code><pre>template&lt;class Tin, class Tlabel, class Comparator, class Boolean&gt;
int ConnectedComponents::connected(const Tin *img, Tlabel *out,
 		     int width, int height, Comparator,
		  Boolean K8_connectivity);
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>
<code>img</code> and <code>out</code> are arrays pointing to the
grayscale image an the resulting label image
respectively. <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are the
dimensions of both of these images. The pitch of both images must be
0. The algorithm doesn't depend on this, but I used the simplest image
format possible to avoid requiring a specific image
class. <code>Comparator</code> is an STL compare object. It is an
object which defines <code>operator()</code> to take two
<code>Tin</code>'s and returns true if these values are equivalent.
The example code in the library uses STL's <code>equal</code> function
object, but you can use anything you like. The final argument
specifies whether the algorithm looks at all 8 neighbors of a pixel or
just 4 neighbors (sideways and up-down). It is a template argument,
but you can pass a bool if you like. I pass a <code>constant</code>
template, which i describe in <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/%7Erahimi/compile-time-flags/">Compile
Time Flags</a>.
</p><p>
Here is an example of how you would use this class:


</p><p>
<table border="1" width="90%"><tbody><tr><td>
<code></code><pre>   <b>// using a bool.</b>
    ConnectedComponents cc(30);
    cc.connected(img, out_uc, width, height,
		 std::equal_to&lt;unsigned char&gt;(),
		 false);
   <b>// using a template constant.</b>
    ConnectedComponents cc(30);
    cc.connected(img, out, width, height,
		 std::equal_to&lt;unsigned char&gt;(),
		 constant&lt;bool,true&gt;());
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>

helpful descriptions of the algorithm). I found these off of
google. You might want to take a look at these if you don't like
coding in C++.
